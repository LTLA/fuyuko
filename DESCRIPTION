Title: Tracing FetchContent Dependency Conflicts
Description: 
    Identify conflicts in FetchContent-driven dependencies within a CMake project.
    This typically involves FetchContent calls to the same repository but different commits.
    Such differences may cause incompatibilities that need to be resolved before the project builds successfuly.
